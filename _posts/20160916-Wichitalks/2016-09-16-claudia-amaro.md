favorite: Although Wichita still needs to define an identity recognizing all of its members and integrating them, I love its history, the people, the tacos. My favorite place is the Keeper of the Plains.
about: Claudia Yaujar-Amaro was born in Tijuana, Mexico. She moved to the United States with her mother and sisters at the age of 12 after her father was killed.

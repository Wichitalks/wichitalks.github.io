favorite: My favorite thing about Wichita is its potential. It offers all of the perks of a small town melded together with the possibilities of a larger city. Great things are happening here and will continue to happen here - case in point, the burgeoning craft beer scene that is putting us on the map - who doesn't love that?
about: Tristan is a born-and-raised Wichitan whose pride in her hometown is evident within minutes of talking to her. She'll gladly tell stories of the fun she had growing up in Wichita - playing down by the river with her brothers, eating at Sub 'N' Stuff and Spaghetti Jacks, playing on the rocketship in Riverside park (Bring Back the Rocket!) and attending every year of RiverFest since her birth (and has the buttons to prove it!). After a 9-year hiatus living away during college and after, she is enjoying living back in Wichita with her husband and showing him all that this great city has to offer.

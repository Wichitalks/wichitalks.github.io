favorite: The prominent and hidden architectural gems, such as The Orpheum, the Kress building, Carthalite, Proudfoot & Bird buildings, and Frank Lloyd Wright’s Allen-Lambe House and Corbin Education building.
about: A native Kansan, Alex has been living in Wichita since 2010 and now refers to it as the hometown he chose. Despite this, he still pronounces the Arkansas River like the state and Greenwich Road like the neighborhood in New York. When not helping entrepreneurs and property owners find solutions to their commercial real estate needs as an advisor at NAI Martens, you can find him volunteer coaching a youth baseball team for League 42, taking in Wichita’s burgeoning live music and visual arts scenes, attending entrepreneurship- and civic-oriented events, or cruising his Vespa down Douglas Avenue. A graduate of Wichita State University with majors in entrepreneurship, management, and economics with a real estate emphasis, he builds a spreadsheet to inform virtually every life decision.

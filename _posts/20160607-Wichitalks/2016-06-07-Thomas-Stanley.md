favorite: My favorite thing about Wichita is the riverwalk, the running culture, the amazing food at Il Vicino and beer at Central Standard.

He enjoys running with his wife, Ashley, their daughter, Charlotte, and son, Peter. He works at the Kansas Leadership Center building partnerships and teaching and coaching around leadership.

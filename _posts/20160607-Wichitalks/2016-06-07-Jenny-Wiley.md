favorite: I love how I can find myself through exploring all Wichita has to offer. People, art, restaurants, culture. It all fills me up with pride and gratitude.
about: Jenny is one of the leaders in the personal development movement in Wichita, and manages and motivates others using her super powers of empathy and developing the best in everyone. She is working towards her certification as a life coach, leads a transformational book club for women, teaches workshops on how to tap into the best version of yourself and just accepted a gig as a camp counselor for an adult summer camp.

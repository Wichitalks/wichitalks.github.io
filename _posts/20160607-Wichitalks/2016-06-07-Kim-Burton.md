favorite: Hard workers and a well-connected community. Wichita does an extraordinary job of making sure everybody knows what's going on around town every week!
about: Kim Burton is an electrical engineer who came from Pittsburg State straight to Wichita in 2002 to work for Cessna Aircraft, which is now Textron Aviation. She loves to read and share information, passions that lead her to become a Little Free Library steward in 2012 when she built a cabinet-like structure in her front lawn for neighbors to take and leave books.

favorite: I have to admit, growing up, I did not appreciate everything Wichita has to offer. However, as I've grown and matured, I have nothing but awe and love for the people that make up our town. Their kindness, their ingenuity, and their entrepreneurial spirit make for an amazing opportunity for incredible development alongside caring neighbors and family values.

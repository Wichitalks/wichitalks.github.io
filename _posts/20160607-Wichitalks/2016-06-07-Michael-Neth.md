favorite: Wichita is where I grew up and I love the new sense of pride that is developing in the city. It's small enough that anybody who wants to can make a difference and it's big enough for that to matter. Also we have Los Pinos and they have the best chimichangas and salsa in North America.
about: Michael Neth has been making art and designing experiences since he was a child. He currently leads product design and development for Callcap.com, helps promote civic hacking as the Project Coordinator for Open Wichita, and occasionally freelances and works on his own get-rich-slow ideas like 54 Hour Game Co. (54hour.com). Mostly, he posts weird things on Twitter and enjoys life with his family â€” Michelle and Tegan. Eventually there will probably be a blog too.

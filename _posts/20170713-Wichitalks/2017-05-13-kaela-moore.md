favorite: Wichita is a hungry city--we want to grow and learn and be a place where people thrive. Also, food trucks.
about: Kaela is a writer, editor, sometimes speaker who likes to tell stories--sometimes true ones, sometimes not. When she's not working at WSU's Community Engagement Institute, she's either on an adventure with her daughter or writing. Both of these activities involve answering questions like "Do spiders have jobs?" and "Why can't we eat cars?" along with obscene amounts of caffeine.

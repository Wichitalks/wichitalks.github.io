favorite: My favorite thing about Wichita is its focus on entrepreneurship. It is amazing to see everyone from Wichita State to local government, fostering the business environment and providing opportunities to businesses and business owners.
about: Grant Boyd is a Senior at Wichita State, where his biggest factor for attending was the aviation business climate in Wichita. He has grown up around airplanes his whole life and got his pilotâ€™s license at age 17. Since, he has worked at numerous aviation companies and has even started his own, Boyd Aviation Group-which is an aviation marketing consulting company.

favorite: My favorite thing about Wichita is how willing the community is to support those in need.
about: Andrew Gough is a “glass-half-full”, or rather, a “mug-half-full”, kind of guy. Take a heavily caffeinated, optimistic Woo, and you have a guy who believes anything can be accomplished. In fact, his ignorance is blissfully guiding Andrew to places he never considered to be part of his big plan. In 2013, he started Reverie Coffee Roasters and in less than 5 years, Andrew opened a second location and expanded his flagship coffee shop to include a Europeanesque bakery and full-service brunch restaurant. Unsure of what he will do next, Andrew is certain to consider the needs for his business to be dependent on satisfying the needs of the community and his team of 50+ employees first.

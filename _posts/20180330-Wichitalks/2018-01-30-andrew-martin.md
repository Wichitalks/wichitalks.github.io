about: Andrew could tell you where he goes to college and what major he is pursuing, but Andrew has started and ended too many conversations with those details. Instead, he will tell you that he is passionate about personal development and powerful questions, and spends most of his time with his head in a book or playing Mario Kart. Although Andrew is clearly a career introvert, he believes in the power of connection. To fulfill that belief, he serves to bring himself and fellow college students to their full potential as a teaching assistant for two incredible leadership classes taught at Wichita State University. Naturally, he still ends this by telling you where he goes to school.

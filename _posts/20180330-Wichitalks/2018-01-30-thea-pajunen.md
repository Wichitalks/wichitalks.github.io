favorite: This is a community brimming with people who truly give a sh*t about making Wichita better.
about: Thea Pajunen moved back to Wichita in 2013 after a decade in Florida, just in time to witness the beginning of Wichita's renaissance. Invigorated by the community's growth and seeing a need for women-specific peer mentorship and support, Thea founded Lean In Wichita Kansas in the fall of 2016. She's committed to empowering the women of Wichita and finding ways to ensure equity and equality in the workplace. Outside of a Lean In meeting, you can find her at Fidelity Bank working as their Marketing Specialist, serving on the Young Professionals of Wichita and Dress for Success Wichita boards, or at a bar listening to live music.

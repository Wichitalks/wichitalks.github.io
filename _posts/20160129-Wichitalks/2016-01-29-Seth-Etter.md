about: (Disclaimer - Seth's Wichitalks presentation video had some technical problems that prevented us from displaying it. Fortunately, Seth gave nearly the same presentation at a local 1 Million Cups, so we're borrowing it from them.)<br><br>Seth is a Senior Application Developer for The OpenGov Foundation who cares a lot about coding and community. He organizes two groups, a software development community called devICT and another called Open Wichita, a civic hacking group aimed at improving the city through technology. He really likes Wichita and wants to help make it as awesome as possible.

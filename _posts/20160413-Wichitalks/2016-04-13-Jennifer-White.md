        Jennifer White is the founder of ICT S.O.S., a volunteer-driven community action group created to fight domestic minor sex trafficking in the Wichita area. Since 2011, ICT S.O.S. has partnered with local social service agencies and law enforcement in a support role to provide donations, volunteers, and to create community awareness. ICT S.O.S. also provides prevention education for middle and high school students through the Tell Your Friends curriculum. Jennifer is also the Race Director for the annual Race 4 Freedom 5K, a project of ICT S.O.S. which benefits a local direct service agency each year with 100% of the proceeds. Jennifer and her husband Chris spent two years as house parents in an independent living program for at-risk young women, and continue to mentor many of the young women they served. Jennifer and Chris have two daughters, who are her inspiration to create a safer community.<br><br><strong>Favorite Thing About Wichita:</strong><br><i>"The partnerships and collaboration that happens around cool projects!"</i><br><br><strong>Contact:</strong><br><a href="https://twitter.com/JenWhiteICT" target="_blank">@JenWhiteICT</a><br>Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/JenWhiteICT" target="_blank">JenWhiteICT</a><br>Jennifer@ICTSOS.org

favorite: My favorite thing about Wichita is the people. I have been all over the world and these are the most energetic, caring, and passionate people I have ever met.
about: Growing up, Chris Callen wanted little to do with the family construction business. As he grew up, Chris focused his education and career efforts in information technology. Little did he know, but his experiences with his father and mother in the company were leaving an impression on him. A year out of college, and this attraction to construction was fully realized. Joining the family business full-time in 2013, Chris has set out to ‘ding the universe’ with two key initiatives — the immersive application to technology to construction, and the perception shift to construction being a sought-after profession.

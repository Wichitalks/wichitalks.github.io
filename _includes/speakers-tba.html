                    We’re looking to surface unique perspectives, passion projects, and compelling stories that can add value to our community but currently live under the radar in your mind, your favorite coffee shop, or your favorite conversation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What you do within the guidelines is wide open to creative interpretation. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you’re not sure your presentation idea is the kind that will be accepted, we encourage you to apply anyway. We’ll give you feedback to help you fine tune your application.

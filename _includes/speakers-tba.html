            <p>
                Please apply if you are passionate about something, anything at all.<br>
                Even if your slides have absolutely no correlation to your presentation,<br>
                if you have one slide repeating 20 times, or you want to act or perform something creative.<br>
                You don't even have to say anything, as long as there is some sort of message.<br><br>
                The guidelines are wide open to creative interpretation.<br><br>
                If you have any question or are unclear about if what you want to do will be accepted, apply anyway.<br>
                We'll give you feedback on whether it fits or if you need to fine tune your application.

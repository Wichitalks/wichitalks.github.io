                Even if your slides have absolutely no correlation to your presentation,<br>
                if you have one slide repeating 20 times, or you want to act or perform something creative.<br>
                You don't even have to say anything, as long as there is some sort of message.<br><br>
                The guidelines are wide open to creative interpretation.<br><br>
                If you have any questions or are unclear about what will be accepted, we encourage you to apply anyway.

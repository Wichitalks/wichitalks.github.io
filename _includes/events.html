        <hr>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you for supporting Wichitalks at Roxy's this past July; we had a blast. We've taken notes, gathered feedback, and have come up with a gameplan for our next event. Stay connected because we'll be announcing the next Wichitalks event soon! In the meantime though, check out our <a href="/previous">Alumni</a> and sign up for the <i><a class="page-scroll" href="#contact">announcement-letter</a></i> at the bottom of the page!</p>

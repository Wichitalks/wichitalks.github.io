                    Wichitalks brings together the passionate individuals, high performers, and creative minds in our community to present on what drives them in an attempt to provide a glimpse into the greater Wichita identity. At each event 10 individuals present, in a rapid fire manner, one after another. With only 20 slides, each auto-advancing every 15 seconds, presentations are brief, fun, insightful, and passionately delivered. Wichitalks is an evening of eclectic presentations, inciting ideas, and creative collisions that wouldnâ€™t have otherwise happened. Absolutely no pitches are allowed. Presenters are individuals in Wichita who have a passion to share. They may be business owners, volunteers, or life-hackers. The goal is to teach something of social value and to spread ideas.

2016 was a great year for Wichitalks. Every event pulled in more and more new people as popularity grew. With over 100 people at our first event, our audience had doubled in size by the most recent one. We couldn’t be more humbled by the welcoming and passionate Wichitans who chose to spend their evening at Wichitalks.

Providing a rich Wichitalks experience is not without its cost. To have what we need to create the Wichitalks experience, we relied heavily on donated items and services, and sometimes were forced to cancel something we were fighting to have.

Wichitalks was technically hibernating this winter, yet, in truth we were strategizing a game plan to keep Wichitalks sustained. Wichitalks is not a non-profit organization, but we run it that way nonetheless, right down to our organizers being volunteers. Still, we are determined to ensure you, our most important asset, are best served. With this is mind, we set about: determining standards and a budget for the event’s vibe and audience experience; costs for necessary services such as photographers, videographers, and catering. As well as a strategic plan to make it all happen.

To ensure Wichitalk's sustainability, the following three revenue streams are necessary:

- **Tickets** - There will be a reduced-price presale and a regular sale for the tickets. The presale opens when an event is announced, and the regular pricing opens when speakers are announced.<br>

- **Donations/Sponsorships** - We welcome these opportunities and will be working with each individually.<br>

- **Patreon** - Anyone who may be a part of the community and wants to support Wichitalks can choose a monthly donation tier where, while you are supporting the event, you will also have the opportunity to receive special offers and extras from Wichitalks. Check out [Patreon here!][patreon]

Wichitalks is a labor of love for all its organizers. We hope that you enjoy seeing individuals from our vibrant Wichita community sharing their passion, and will support these necessary changes to ensure we continue to provide you the Wichitalks experience you've come to expect.

Thank you.

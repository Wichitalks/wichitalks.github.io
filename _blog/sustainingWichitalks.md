In order for Wichitalks to keep going, there is something I want to be transparent about: How Wichitalks works, financially.

### The 2016 Wichitalks Business Plan

 - Tickets: Free
 - Donations: Encouraged
 - Sponsorships: ...wellll we had one
 - Making up the difference: my pocket

 I was trying to go the non-profit route and imagined that businesses would LOVE to support this by "sponsoring" and keep it going. Turns out, I have absolutely no way to correlate their sponsorship dollars to any ROI. Yes, I'll take hundreds of your hard earned cash and promise that you'll be thanked on stage! Didn't quite work the way I imagined. Gathering sponsorships and grants takes a lot of work, and there is no real guarantee that it will work.

### The 2017 Wichitalks Business Plan

  - Tickets: see calculation below
  - - Presale: Wichitalks obsorbs processing fees
  - - Regular Sale: You pay processing fees for tickets (extra $1.54)
  - Donations: Encouraged
  - Patreon: If you want to get some cool things
  - Sponsorships: Negotiated on a per sponsorship basis
  - Making up the difference: Hopefully not my pocket

The math is pretty straight forward really:
 ```
 ticket price = ([event expenses] - [sponsorships]) / [number of tickets]
 ```
 There are ways that Wichitalks could be made free again, but that would require someone to swoop in and take care of the expenses, and as 2016 proved, it's not a reasonable thing to expect. In the event Wichitalks receives a full donation, I can always refund the tickets purchased and make the remaining tickets free.

 If you're wondering what those expenses are and how I came up with these numbers, here it is:
 
* Venue: $500 - Donated
* Food & Beverages: $0 - $200 - Depending on the venue
* Video: $500 - Thanks to Aspired Media
* Photography: $250 - This is only a guess
* Graphic Design: $270 - Thank you Barrett Morgan Design
* Advertisement: $100 - Promotional materials and promoted social media posts
* Overhead: $15 - Website stuff
* Venue and Stage Design: $185 - Contributes to stage vibe

These numbers are a little flexible, but that means where I save in one, I'm able to improve on another. This represents an approximate budget for what has been going on. In the event that money is left over, the remaining funds are reinvested into Wichitalks to improve small things here and there.

Wichitalks has been growing, each event more people attend than the last, Wichitalks at WSU being over 200 people. This was with free tickets. I'm shooting for 150 tickets to cover the costs, which is probably on the high end of what I should be expecting going from free to paid tickets, but after talking with a bunch of people and comparing equivalent events, Wichitalks had settled on $10 a ticket. I'll just have to do my best to make it work.

If you want to share an idea or just tell me what you think, reach out on social media or over email. I'd love your feedback.

Stay cool,

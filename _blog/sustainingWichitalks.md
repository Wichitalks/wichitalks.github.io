2016 was a great year for Wichitalks. Every event pulled in more and more new people as our popularity grew. With over 100 people at our first event, our audience had doubled in size by the most recent one. We couldn’t be more humbled by the welcoming and passionate Wichitans who chose to spend their evening at Wichitalks.

Providing a rich Wichitalks experience does not come without a cost. To have what we need to create the Wichitalks experience, we have relied heavily on donated items and services, and sometimes were forced to cancel something we were fighting to have.

Wichitalks was technically hibernating this winter; yet, in truth we were strategizing a game plan to keep Wichitalks sustained. Wichitalks is not a non-profit organization, but we run it that way nonetheless. A prime example being our organizers being classified as volunteers. Still we are determined to ensure you that our most important assets are being served in the best way that we can. With all of this in mind, we set about determining standards for all of the following: a budget for the event’s vibe and audience experience, costs for necessary services such as photographers, videographers, and catering. We then took those standards and created a strategic plan to execute them.

To ensure Wichitalk's sustainability, the following three revenue streams are necessary:

- **Tickets** - There will be a reduced-price pre-sale and a regular sale for the tickets. The pre-sale opens when an event is announced, and the regular pricing opens when speakers are announced.<br>

- **Donations/Sponsorships** - We welcome these opportunities and will be working with each individually.<br>

- **Patreon** - Anyone who may be a part of the community and wants to support Wichitalks can choose a monthly donation tier where, while you are supporting the event, you will also have the opportunity to receive special offers and extras from Wichitalks. Check out [Patreon here!][patreon]

Wichitalks is a labor of love for all of its organizers. We hope that you enjoy seeing individuals from our vibrant Wichita community sharing their passion, and will support these necessary changes to ensure we continue to provide you the Wichitalks experience that you've come to expect.

Thank you,  
Kevin

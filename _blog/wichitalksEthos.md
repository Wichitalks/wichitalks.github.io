>Ethos — the characteristic spirit of a culture, era, or community as manifested in its beliefs and aspirations.

I am often asked what Wichitalks is and my typical response is something along the lines of: a mini TED-like talk from passionate Wichitans where each talk is 20 slides, 15-second auto-advance, no pitches ...” and the description usually died off from there on out. What this describes could be any event and doesn’t demonstrate the full spirit of why we’re doing this.

Wichitans are some of the most creative, hard-working, and inspiring people I’ve ever met. I believe in Wichita, its diversity, and most importantly its [audacious opportunity][opportunity capital]. Recall the [eye-opening numbers measuring Wichita’s status][James Chung], and contrast that with how you feel, what is happening, and where you viscerally go when thinking about our beautiful city. To me, there is a disconnect, and that gap is a sign we’re not giving up without a fight. Wichitalks exists to harness this ethos and spread awareness of our rallying optimism.

Many of the communities in Wichita don’t communicate with one another. Their efforts are applied toward many different visions of the future. These visions, as diverse as every one of these leaders, represent Wichita’s future. Wichitalks gathers them together for an evening at a space that encourages open-minded and collaborative conversation. Yet, this isn’t always in the form you’d imagine.

It’s the passion [Thomas Stanley][Thomas Stanley] has for running, [Kim Burton][Kim Burton] has for neighborhood literacy, [Lamont Anderson][Lamont Anderson] has for inspiring action, [Alex Pemberton][Alex Pemberton] has for the spaces we inhabit, [Kelsey Ryan][Kelsey Ryan] has for data driven reporting, [Seth Etter][Seth Etter] has for open data, and [Claudia Amaro][Claudia Amaro] has for immigrant families. The number of visionaries and the opportunity for everyone in the city to contribute in their own unique way grows every single day.

We’re not going to get anywhere by shouting that we’re the best, the loudest. That part is obvious. While we are home to some of the greats, Wichitalks presenters lean passion-forward in the most humble manner. By sharing and teaching without any expectation of return, a meaningful connection with the community forms. You leave feeling inspired, armed with new philosophies and viewpoints, yet not tired from sales pitches. In essence, these talks or ideas taken as a whole end up being greater than their individual sum - a real investment in the people we do business with every day. The very individuals who shop alongside us at Dillons, run down Douglas, or are the parents of our children’s peers.

Wichitalks envisions a Wichita of opportunity for everyone, a Wichita not afraid of taking on controversial topics, and a Wichita with that [HQ swagger][HQ Swagger] by offering a space for these ideas to radiate and grow.

Thank you,  
Kevin

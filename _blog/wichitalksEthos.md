>Ethos - the characteristic spirit of a culture, era, or community as manifested in its beliefs and aspirations.

I have been so fortunate to have been surrounded by this community in Wichita. It feels almost by chance that I arrived here, and through a series of growing friendships, have been given room to root. Thank you to everyone who has been involved and supported Wichitalks, and given that Wichitalks is now a little over a year old, I want to share what I feel Wichitalks' Ethos is. From the outset, I wanted Wichitalks to explore and help define Wichita's identity and the ethos that has arrisen from the community resonates with the vibe of Wichitalks.

### Passion Forward

I try to coach all of our presenters to be passion forward in their presentations, making sure that they understand no pitching is allowed. The idea is that by getting up and sharing or teaching without any expectation of financial results, you are able to connect with the community at a much deeper level. Many of the presenters are business owners, and this makes sense. These entreprenuerial types found something they love to do and are making a living doing it. Wichitalks gives them the opportunity to share that passion with an open minded audience without the sell.

In conversation with one of my friends, he shared with me an enlightened idea.
>"Don't miss the opportunity to make a new friend because you are too busy trying to make a sale."

Golden. Be passion forward.

### Open and Transparent

Wichitalks has taught me that by being honest and open about what is happening, people are able to learn from my mistakes, make improvements on my shortcomings, and build trust in the vision and intentions I have for the organization. I can get quick feedback from the community to help Wichitalks reflect Wichita.

I'm not doing this for any financial gain. I am doing this because I would like to help guide the community into a community I hope to someday build my own business in.

### Honesty, Community, and Love

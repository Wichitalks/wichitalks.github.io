[Tristan Neth-Juergensen][Tristan Neth-Juergensen] wrote Wichitalks about her experience and we're incredibly humbled to share it.
<hr>

From someone who is born and raised in Wichita, the platform Wichitalks offers is merely one that allows me to share how much how I love my hometown in front of a larger audience. Not only that, I get to hear from others who love Wichita as much as I do. I was born here. I left, I came back. 

I love Wichita. 

And I love that Wichitalks affords us the ability to listen to others who not only love the town, but have ideas on how to make it *better*. Do I hear the same thing from each speaker? A hard and fast no. I've learned and experienced so much from each speaker that has presented at Wichitalks. Is the message the same? Maybe. But is the perspective different? ABSOLUTELY. I would hear that same message over and over again from a myriad of different voices if it meant that I would get to experience the love, enthusiasm and passion that everyone has for this town. I am proud to say that I am Wichita born and raised, and I am proud that I was able to share that love for ICT during one of Wichitalks presentations. 

I love Wichita. 

Wichitalks has brought together the community in way that is not only productive but empowering. You know walking into the room that you are but a drop in an ocean of people that feel the same way you do about Wichita, and that feeling is indescribable. Wichitalks has created a sense of belonging and a sense of action in a town that for quite some time has been stagnant. You can feel the pulse of that action vibrating in the community - it has resonated within those that feel the pull of that Wichita has to offer. 

I love Wichita. Wichitalks loves Wichita. 

And now Wichita is loving Wichita.

[Jennifer White][Jennifer White] of [ICT SOS][ICT SOS] wrote this in a letter to me when I asked her about her Wichitalks experience and I'm incredibly humbled by it.
<hr>

I wasn't able to attend the first Wichitalks. To be honest, I didn't really "get" what it was until after that first event as I started seeing people post about it online. There was an instant buzz about the event and I knew it was something I wanted to be a part of. In my role with ICT SOS, I have spoken publicly many times but I'm not a polished speaker by any means. The structured format intrigued me and I saw it as a way to polish my speaking skills a little by forcing myself out of my comfort zone. I found videos of past presenters and watched them multiple times to get a feel for the format. (Sorry for stalking you, Kenton & Aaron) It scared me. Like, really freaked me out. But I thought I'd throw my hat in the ring. When I got the acceptance email my first thought was, "Yay!" My next was, "Oh, crap. What did I just do to myself?"

I also knew that I couldn't just pitch my organization which is what I had mostly been asked to do in the past. I would tell my story of how I got involved, how ICT SOS got its start and what opportunities we had for people to join in our work through support or volunteering. I had that down. The format and "No Pitches, Just Passion" rule was going to force me to do something different. And while that scared me, it was the reason I wanted to do it.

I have never practiced so hard for a speech. Like, ever. I worked on my slides, printed them out, rearranged them, set timers, practiced, rearranged and did it all over again until I felt I had something worth sharing. My final Wichitalk product is something I'm very proud of. Was it perfect? No. But I got the chance to share something that really meant a lot to me with a crowd that was so welcoming and receptive. As a speaker, it doesn't get much better than that.

After the event, I was approached by several people who said they were moved by what I had shared. I was hugged, congratulated, invited to collaborate on projects, and offered help in my mission. Some of those people were friends or acquaintances. Some of them were strangers who are now friends. I met people who are passionate about our city. Some are passionate about business, or information, or pride in our community or technology. But, every one of them freely shared that passion with the crowd and we got a glimpse into what is driving our city forward in 5 minute chunks.

Since the event I spoke at, I have also volunteered at an event and that was also a great experience. (And required much less prep work and stress on my part!)

Our city is so full of dreamers. But if we don't know about those dreams, we can't help each other get there. I think what Wichitalks does best is provide a platform for people to share their dreams. Whether it's a little free library in every neighborhood, a new way of thinking about community, a brilliant business idea or race cars and explosions... when we know what others are dreaming about, we can help each other make those dreams reality. (Maybe with the exception of blowing things up, Sean Amore!) As dreamers, when we put those dreams out there for others to hear, it's scary and hard and did I say scary? But, when you look out into that crowd and realize that for 5 minutes that whole room is dreaming with you, it is magic. And when a few of those people connect with you to move that dream beyond a 20 slide presentation into actual implementation, it changes our city.

So, in conclusion: Wichitalks is scary, magical and changing our city 5 minutes and 20 slides at a time.
